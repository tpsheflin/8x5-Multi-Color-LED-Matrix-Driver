8x5-Mulit-Color-LED-Matrix-Driver-Code for Arduino UNO

I purchased this 8 x 5 LED Matrix Display, CSM-58261EG-21, from the Rochester Hamfest several years ago (2017) and finally had the time to hook it up and make it work.
The display has two LED's per "pixel" Red and Green and when bot are enabled the color is amber. 
Parts: Arduino UNO, 10 390 Ohm resistors, 36 jumper wires, CSM-58261EG-21 Display, large bread board, small bread board, difuser (cut piece of paper).
